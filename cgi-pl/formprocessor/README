This script will process an html form. The following options are available:
1. Form data can be emailed,
2. Form data can be written to a file. 
3. Email addresses can be written to a database.
4. A text file can be emailed to form user. 
5. Include field names.

###
General Instructions
###
Install form_processor.pl in your cgi-bin and chmod to 755. Install cgi-lib.pl in your cgi-bin and chmod to 755.

The html form you design must include the following fields:

<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="your_email@your_server.com">
<input type=hidden name="subject" value="Subject of Email to Yourself">
<input type=hidden name="redirect" value=
"http://www.page_shown_after_submit.com">

The form action must point to the location of the script on your server.
<form action="/cgi-bin/form_processor.pl" method="POST">

In additon, if you are using Option No. 4, the field that gets the users email address MUST be named user_email.
<input type="TEXT" name="02)user_email">
(any digits may be used, purpose of digits is explained below)

When designing the html form, all fields that you want input from must begin with a digit and a right parenthesis i.e. <input type="TEXT" name="01)name" value="Kendall">. The digit serves to order the fields in the results you receive.
For instance;
<input type="TEXT" name="01)name" value="Kendall">
<input type="TEXT" name="02)email" value="kendall@command-o.com">
Returns:
name -- Kendall
email -- kendall@command-o.com

Whereas;
<input type="TEXT" name="02)name" value="Kendall">
<input type="TEXT" name="01)email" value="kendall@command-o.com">
Returns:
email -- kendall@command-o.com
name -- Kendall

Keep in mind that the name of the field (minus the digits and parenthesis) will be used as the description of the field in the results you receive. 

If you want a field to be required, use the following:
<input type="TEXT" name="01)required-name" value="Kendall">. 
This will give the user a message that he needs to fill in the "name" field to continue. This example will produce the following result:
name -- Kendall
